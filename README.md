# node-album-api

In a dev challenge I was given an API so I could design a [front end](https://github.com/miguel-hv/angular-album-api-front) in order to consume it.
I used Node to clone the given API given so I could [deploy it in Heroku](https://albums-api-dev-challenge.herokuapp.com) along with the designed front-end.

This API features MongoDB to store data in just two related models: Artists and Albums.
